Despite living under constant surveillance, Winston begins to rebel against the Party’s control, seeking truth and freedom. The novel explores themes of surveillance, censorship, the manipulation of truth, and the loss of individuality. Orwell's haunting portrayal of a world where freedom is crushed under an authoritarian regime remains a chilling warning about the dangers of totalitarianism and the suppression of dissent.",
